Give a bitbake of all your components with "debug" enabled in master cmake.

1)Go to debug configurations in eclipse
2)Give the process/binary(say sdc_ctl) path under "Main" => select from image folder in oe.. This binary should be compiled in debug mode so as to have all debug symbols.

3)Give the GDB debugger path in "Main" under "Debugger" as /opt/tooling/codesourcery/MGC-2018.05-7-arm-gcc-7.3.1/Sourcery_CodeBench_for_AArch64/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gdb

Gen4 => AArch64

4)Give the shared library path in "Shared Libraries" under "Debugger" => select from image folder in oe..

Give a check on "load shared library symbols automatically"

5)Give the port number(say 1000) and the host name/IP address as the address of the target

6)Check the check box on "disable auto build".

6)Execute /opt/platform/install-gdb.sh so as to install gdbserver  on target

7)In target, execute as below:
gdbserver  host_name:1000 "binary name"
gdbserver  host_name:1000 sdc_ctl -v encrypt -m RSA_OAEP_SHA384_MGF1SHA384 -k 1000 -f t100 -o enc384_1k

8)if gdb gets stuck, then kill with "kill -9 PID"

9)Use F6 for stepping over and F5 for stepping into. If you add a breakpoint and hit F8(i.e. execute),then the flow will come till the added breakpoint.
